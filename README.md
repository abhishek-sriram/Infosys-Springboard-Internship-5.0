# Human Stress Detection and Prediction Using ANN


## 🌟 Introduction  
Human stress is the body's response to challenging or demanding situations. While short-term stress can improve focus, chronic stress negatively impacts physical and mental health. This project aims to detect and classify stress levels using physiological sleep data through an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model.

## 🚩 Problem Statement  
The objective of this project is to develop a system that detects human stress levels during sleep using physiological parameters. By training an ANN, the system classifies sleep data as **"Stressed"** or **"Not Stressed"**.

---

## 📊 Parameters  
The system uses the following parameters for stress detection:  
- **Snoring Rate**  
- **Respiratory Rate**  
- **Body Temperature**  
- **Limb Movement**  
- **Blood Oxygen**  
- **Eye Movement**  
- **Sleep Hours**  
- **Heart Rate**
